The easiest way to test your changes to the damage logs is with another player.


# Testing with bots
Some areas of the damage logs do not work with bots.<br>
For example, a bot cannot open the damage logs interface.

## Spawning bots
In order to test the addon with a bot, start a listen/dedicated server (not singleplayer) and use the console command `bot` to force a bot to connect.<br>
Use the `bot` command multiple times to create multiple bots.
